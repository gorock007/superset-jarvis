# superset-jarvis

**You talk to one agent. A team of agents does the building.**

Jarvis is an open-source workflow for running one coordinating agent plus a
fleet of workers inside [Superset](https://superset.sh). It ships as a Claude
Code plugin. The coordinating agent, called Jarvis, plans the work and writes
a short brief for each task. It starts worker agents in separate Superset
terminals, reviews what they hand back, and commits it. You never manage the
workers. You talk to Jarvis, and Jarvis manages them.

## Who it's for

Jarvis is a good fit if you:

- **Already use Superset** with Claude Code, and maybe Codex or OpenCode too.
- **Build a product day to day** and want several agents working in parallel
  without keeping track of each terminal yourself.
- **Keep running out of usage**, and want the expensive models saved for hard
  work while routine tasks go to cheaper or free models.
- **Want one clean commit per task** and a record of every decision, instead
  of a dozen agents all writing to git at once.
- **Lose track of work between sessions.** Jarvis keeps its state in files in
  your repo, so you can pick up tomorrow where you left off.

It's probably not for you if:

- **You don't use Superset.** Jarvis runs on `superset agents create` and
  `superset terminals read|send`. It won't work in a plain terminal or
  another IDE.
- **You only need one large parallel job**, like splitting a migration into
  ten slices, each on its own branch. Superset's built-in
  `superset:orchestrate` skill is made for that. See the
  [comparison](#jarvis-vs-supersetorchestrate).
- **You'd rather work in a single agent session** and review every edit as it
  happens.

## What it does

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 🧠 **One lead agent** | You talk only to Jarvis. It plans, decides, and briefs, and it does no editing in its own terminal. |
| 🛠️ **Parallel workers** | Each task runs in its own Superset terminal in the same workspace. Jarvis starts independent tasks at the same time. |
| 🎯 **Model routing** | Each task goes to the cheapest agent and model that can do it well: Claude Code (`fable` / `claude-opus-5-5` / `sonnet` / `haiku`), Codex, or OpenCode's free models. |
| 📉 **Usage bands** | Jarvis reads Claude Code's own 5-hour usage numbers and the burn rate. Past 50%, or on pace to run out before the window resets, workers stop getting `fable`. Past 75%, new heavy work goes to Codex. `jarvis spawn` enforces both. |
| 🚦 **A cap on Claude sessions** | At most 3 Claude sessions run at once by default, Jarvis included. Codex and OpenCode don't count. Extra briefs wait in a queue or go to the free tier, so parallel work doesn't use up your 5-hour window in two hours. |
| ❓ **Grouped questions** | Workers never wait for you. They write their questions into a handoff file, and Jarvis collects them into one numbered message for you. |
| ✅ **Review and commit** | Jarvis checks each handoff against `git status`, reads the diff, and runs your checks. Then it commits only the listed files, one commit per task. |
| 📒 **Memory in your repo** | `handoffs/OPEN.md` lists what's running, what's blocked, and what's next, so `/clear` and new sessions don't lose anything. |
| 💸 **Cost controls that are enforced** | Routine steps are one command each (`jarvis status`, `spawn`, `merge`). A free watcher wakes Jarvis when work lands and clears it after a long idle, instead of paying to reload its whole context. Subagents run on `sonnet`, and a security review runs once per merge. |

The plugin has two skills:

- **`jarvis:setup`** runs once per repo. It asks you a few questions and adds
  the Jarvis workflow files to your project.
- **`jarvis:run`** is the playbook Jarvis follows every session: briefing,
  starting workers, checking on them, reviewing, and merging.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Why |
| --- | --- |
| [Superset](https://docs.superset.sh/install) desktop app and CLI (built against CLI v1.28) | Jarvis starts and talks to workers through `superset agents` and `superset terminals` |
| [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) configured as a Superset agent | Jarvis itself and most workers run on it |
| A git repository | Jarvis commits each handoff |
| *Optional:* Codex agent in Superset | Images and other media, computer-use testing, and extra work when your Claude usage is high |
| *Optional:* OpenCode agent in Superset | Free models for small, tightly scoped tasks |
| `jq` (and `python3` for `jarvis usage`) | `handoffs/bin/jarvis` reads JSON from Superset and Claude Code. Without `jq` the cap, band and idle guard fail open. |
| *Optional:* a [TypeSafe](https://docs.typesafe.ai) API key in `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | Brief lint and one-line worker polling through Jev. See [Optional: Jev](#optional-jev). |

Without Codex or OpenCode, Jarvis still works. Those tasks go to Claude
models instead.

## Installation

Pick **one** of these.

### Option 1: Claude Code plugin marketplace (recommended)

Inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add gorock007/superset-jarvis
/plugin install jarvis@superset-jarvis
```

Updates arrive through `/plugin`, and the skills are named `jarvis:setup`
and `jarvis:run`.

### Option 2: Skills CLI

For Claude Code, Codex, or any agent that reads `SKILL.md` files:

```bash
npx skills add gorock007/superset-jarvis
```

It finds two skills, `setup` and `run`. Install both.

### Option 3: Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gorock007/superset-jarvis.git
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -R superset-jarvis/plugins/jarvis/skills/setup ~/.claude/skills/jarvis-setup
cp -R superset-jarvis/plugins/jarvis/skills/run   ~/.claude/skills/jarvis-run
```

### Check that it installed

Open a new Claude Code session and ask *"what skills do you have?"* You should
see `setup` and `run` from the `jarvis` plugin.

## Quick start

### 1. Set up Jarvis in your repo (once)

Open your project's workspace in Superset. In any Claude Code session, say:

> **set up Jarvis in this repo**

`jarvis:setup` checks that the `superset` CLI works and which agents you have
configured. Then it asks all its questions in one message, with answers
already guessed from your repo, so you can often just say "yes":

1. Project name
2. Where the app lives (repo root or a subfolder)
3. Checks workers must run before handing off, such as `bun run typecheck && bun test` or `pytest && ruff check .`
4. What only Jarvis may do besides git, such as applying migrations, deploying, or editing lockfiles
5. How you check finished work: a phone build, a browser URL, CLI commands, or tests only
6. Shared files workers should change as little as possible
7. How many Claude sessions may run at once, Jarvis included (default 3)
8. Whether you're comfortable sending small tasks to OpenCode's free models
9. Usage band thresholds (default 50% and 75%)
10. Which of your globally enabled plugins to switch off in this repo
11. Whether to add the statusline tap that lets Jarvis read your 5-hour usage
12. Whether to install Jev

It then writes `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `handoffs/` and `.claude/`. If any
of them already exist, it **merges** the new sections into them and shows
you the diff first. Running it again in a repo set up with an older version
upgrades that repo. It also checks which model IDs your
Superset host accepts and replaces any it doesn't recognize.

### 2. Start Jarvis

From a Superset terminal (find your project ID with `superset projects list`):

```bash
superset ws create --project <projectId> --name main --checkout local --local \
  --agent claude --model claude-opus-5-5 --effort high \
  --prompt "You are Jarvis. Use the jarvis:run skill: read handoffs/JARVIS.md and handoffs/OPEN.md, run handoffs/bin/jarvis start, then tell me what's open."
superset terminals create --workspace <workspaceId> --command "handoffs/bin/jarvis watch"
```

The second command starts the watcher. It's a plain loop with no model, so
it costs no tokens. It wakes Jarvis when a handoff lands. Jarvis starts it
itself if it isn't running.

Or, in the Superset desktop app, open the project's shared-checkout
workspace, launch Claude Code with model **claude-opus-5-5** and effort **high**, and
send the same first message.

> `--checkout local` matters. Jarvis and its workers share one working copy,
> and only Jarvis uses git.

### 3. Talk to it

> Add a dark mode toggle to settings and fix the flaky login test.

Jarvis writes two briefs, starts two workers on suitable models, and tells you
what it did. When the workers finish, it reviews their work, commits it, and
tells you what to check.

## Talking to Jarvis

Plain language works. Some useful phrases:

| Say | Jarvis will |
| --- | --- |
| "spin off a worker for X" / "delegate this" | Write a brief, pick a model, and start a worker |
| "what's open?" | Summarize running workers, pending questions, and the to-do list |
| "check on the workers" | Read worker terminals and new handoffs in one pass |
| "merge the handoffs" | Review, run checks, commit each finished handoff, and push |
| "I'm running low on usage" | Move to the amber or red band and send new work to cheaper models |
| "answers: 1. yes 2. use Postgres" | Pass your answers to the right workers |

Jarvis only stops to ask you about **product decisions** or **risky
actions**: deleting real data, force-pushing, rewriting history, touching
production, or spending money. It makes everything else, like which model,
how to split the work, and when to start a worker, on its own and tells you
in one line.

## How it works

```
 ┌────────── brief ──────────┐
 │                           ▼
Jarvis                  worker (own terminal, shared checkout)
 ▲  │                        │
 │  │   status: blocked ◀────┤  questions, all at once
 │  └── answers ────────────▶│
 │                           │
 └──── status: done ◀────────┘  handoff: files changed, checks run, notes
        │
        ├─ file list vs git status
        ├─ diff review (+ run checks)
        ├─ Jarvis-only steps (migrations, lockfiles, releases)
        └─ one commit → move handoff to handoffs/merged/ → push → close terminal
```

**1. Brief.** Jarvis writes `handoffs/briefs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.md`. It
names the exact files, an existing pattern to copy, what "done" means and the
command that proves it, and which files the worker may and may not touch.
**The more precise the brief, the smaller the model it needs.**

**2. Start.** `handoffs/bin/jarvis spawn <brief>` lints the brief and
checks the usage band and the Claude cap. Then it runs `superset agents
create` with the agent, model, and effort from the brief header, and records
the terminal ID in the brief and in `OPEN.md`.

**3. Ask once.** If a worker has questions, it writes them all into its first
handoff with `status: blocked`. Jarvis collects questions from every blocked
worker into one message for you, then sends each worker its answers with
`superset terminals send`.

**4. Build.** The worker does the one phase its brief describes, runs the
checks, and writes a handoff listing the files it changed. A job with
several phases gets one brief per phase. Each new worker starts fresh from
the previous handoff instead of carrying 300k tokens of history.

**5. Wait without spending.** Jarvis doesn't poll or sleep. `jarvis watch`
wakes it when a handoff lands. If Jarvis has sat idle long enough for its
prompt cache to expire, the watcher sends `/clear` first. The fresh session
then reloads from `OPEN.md` for a fraction of what reloading the old
conversation would cost.

**6. Review and merge.** `jarvis merge <handoff> --check` compares the file
list with `git status`. Jarvis then reads the diff and runs the checks if
needed. `jarvis merge` commits **only those files** with a `Co-Authored-By`
line naming the worker, moves the handoff to `handoffs/merged/`, pushes,
closes the worker's terminal and updates `OPEN.md`, all in one call.

Two rules keep the shared checkout safe:

1. **Only Jarvis uses git.** Workers never commit, stash, reset, check out,
   rebase, or clean.
2. **Workers never wait for you.** Their questions go through Jarvis.

## What gets added to your repo

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE.md` | A few lines every session loads: who is Jarvis and who is a worker, and your checks. Kept short because workers load it too. |
| `AGENTS.md` | The worker rules, read by Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode: git rules, shared-file rules, ask once, one brief then hand off, handoff format |
| `handoffs/JARVIS.md` | Jarvis's rules for this project: what only Jarvis may do, how you verify work, shared files, budget rules. Only Jarvis reads it. |
| `handoffs/jarvis.conf` | The Claude cap, band thresholds, idle limit |
| `handoffs/bin/jarvis` | `start`, `status`, `spawn`, `merge`, `watch`, `band`, `usage`, plus the idle guard hook and the statusline tap |
| `handoffs/bin/cc_usage_audit.py` | Prices your local Claude Code transcripts for `jarvis usage` |
| `handoffs/OPEN.md` | The one pending list: Jarvis's terminal, usage band, running workers, questions for you, to-do |
| `handoffs/TEMPLATE.md` | Handoff format |
| `handoffs/briefs/` | Briefs Jarvis writes, plus `TEMPLATE.md` |
| `handoffs/merged/` | Reviewed handoffs, committed together with the work they describe |
| `handoffs/bin/jev.sh` | Optional Jev helper. Does nothing without a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. Its log, `handoffs/.jev/`, is git-ignored. |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Subagents on `sonnet`; security-guidance reviews once per commit instead of after every stop; the idle guard and the statusline tap; plugins this repo doesn't use switched off. Merged into any settings you already have. |
| `.claude/agents/scout.md` | Read-only explorer subagent pinned to `sonnet`. Answers in under 300 words. |
| `.claude/agents/diff-reviewer.md` | Read-only diff reviewer subagent pinned to `sonnet` |

`handoffs/` is **tracked in git on purpose**. It's your project's record of
what was decided and why.

## Model routing

The tier depends on one question: **can the brief say what "done" looks like
and how to verify it?** If yes, Claude Opus 5.5 at `high` can handle it, and that covers
most work. If no (the approach isn't decided, the spec is unclear, the cause
is unknown, or a wrong call would be expensive), it goes to `fable`. How
*undecided* a task is matters more than how big it is.

| Tier | Claude Code | Codex | OpenCode (free) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Top: worker must decide the approach | `fable` · high | `gpt-6-astra` · high | never |
| Workhorse: substantial but specified | `claude-opus-5-5` · high | `gpt-5.6-sol` · high | never |
| Light: scoped tweaks, docs, audits | `sonnet` · medium | `gpt-5.6-terra` · medium | if tightly scoped |
| Trivial: renames, formatting | `haiku` · low | `gpt-5.6-luna` · low | **first choice** |

These always go to Codex: **any image or media asset** and **app testing that
needs computer use**. Security work goes to `gpt-5.6-sol` when possible.

**Workers default to Claude Opus 5.5.** It is pinned as `claude-opus-5-5`
rather than left to the `opus` alias, so a worker never silently lands on
Opus 5. Opus 5.5 costs less per token than Opus 5 ($4 / $20 per million) and
finishes agentic coding work with fewer tokens, so it is the right home for
well-specified briefs. It runs at `medium` when a brief is tightly fenced.
Its thinking is always on, so Jarvis always passes `--effort`.

**Jarvis itself runs on Opus 5.5 at `high` too.** It used to run on Fable
5.1. [`eval/jarvis-model/`](eval/jarvis-model/) tested `fable`/`high`,
`claude-opus-5-5`/`high` and `claude-opus-5-5`/`xhigh` on 40 routing briefs
and 8 handoff reviews with planted defects, three times each. All three
picked the right tier for 95% of briefs and caught every planted defect.
Fable cost 2.8× as much per call, and `xhigh` added only a false alarm.
Fable is still the top tier for workers whose task has an undecided shape.
`jarvis usage` shows Jarvis's real cost per turn by model.

**OpenCode is the free tier.** Jarvis considers it before `sonnet` or `haiku`,
because every small task it handles saves your Claude and Codex quota. Jarvis
tells OpenCode exactly which files to change and which pattern to follow, and
never gives it top- or workhorse-tier work. Free models are run by third
parties, so it never sees real credentials or user data. If OpenCode gets a
task wrong, Jarvis gives it one correction, then moves the task to `sonnet`.

At most 3 Claude sessions run at once, Jarvis included (configurable). Past
that, `jarvis spawn` refuses. The brief then waits under To-do in `OPEN.md`,
or goes to OpenCode or Codex if it fits them.

> Model IDs change over time. `jarvis:setup` checks which IDs your Superset
> host accepts and updates the table. The full reasoning is in
> [`model-routing.md`](plugins/jarvis/skills/run/references/model-routing.md).

## Usage-aware spending

Jarvis and every Claude worker draw from the same usage limit, so Jarvis
tracks a **band** and records it in `OPEN.md`:

| Band | Trigger | What changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 Green | under 50%, and not on pace to run out | The routing table as written |
| 🟡 Amber | 50%+, or on pace to use the whole 5-hour window before it resets (40% in the first hour counts) | Workers don't get `fable`. Those briefs start on Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`) at `high` instead. Running `fable` workers finish their current phase, hand off `status: partial`, and restart on Opus 5.5. Jarvis never stops them mid-edit. |
| 🔴 Red | 75%+, a usage-limit message, or a failed start | New top- and workhorse-tier briefs go to Codex. Claude is kept for Jarvis and workers already running. |

The numbers come from Claude Code itself. The repo's statusline is a small
tap that saves the 5-hour and 7-day readings and then runs your own
statusline unchanged. `jarvis status` turns the reading into a band, and
`jarvis spawn` enforces it. Running agents in parallel doesn't make any
single task more expensive, but it squeezes a day's spend into one window.
That's why the band watches the pace as well as the total. Jarvis doesn't
change its own model mid-session. It sends work elsewhere, so the remaining
budget goes to coordination.

## Token efficiency

Version 0.3 came out of measuring where Jarvis's usage actually went, over
12 days of real transcripts. The coordinator cost more than the workers it
coordinated ($251 against $222 at API prices). Most of that went on waiting
and checking, not on deciding. Each measured cause now has a mechanism
behind it, not just advice:

| Measured cause | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| 18 turns (2%) that reloaded an idle coordinator's whole context cost 31% of its spend | `jarvis watch` clears Jarvis after a long idle before waking it, and a prompt guard stops your first message after one |
| Routine check-ins were 46% of coordinator spend, at ~$0.25 each | `jarvis status`, `spawn` and `merge` turn many turns into one call |
| A security-review hook ran after every stop of every worker: 116 runs, $71 | Per-stop review off, one review per merge commit, on Sonnet |
| Built-in subagents inherited Opus and Fable: $59 | `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=sonnet` in the repo's settings |
| Workers carried whole jobs to 350–420k context | One brief per phase, a shorter `CLAUDE.md`, unused plugins off |
| 11 sessions at once used up the 5-hour window in 2.5 hours | A cap on Claude sessions, and a band that watches the burn rate |

`handoffs/bin/jarvis usage` reports the numbers that show whether this
worked: coordinating ÷ building (about 1.13 when measured, target ≤ 0.3),
cost per merged handoff, and the worst 5-hour window. Details are in
[`efficiency.md`](plugins/jarvis/skills/run/references/efficiency.md).

## Optional: Jev

[Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) is TypeSafe's fast decision model. It doesn't
write text. You send it some state and yes/no, pick-one, or rating questions,
and it returns probabilities in well under a second for a fraction of a cent.
Jarvis can use it for two small, frequent judgements, through
`handoffs/bin/jev.sh`:

- **Brief lint.** Before a worker starts, `jev.sh brief <file>` checks the
  brief for the five things that let a smaller model do the job (exact files,
  a pattern to copy, done plus the command that proves it, a scope fence, the
  prior handoff) and names what's missing.
- **Worker polling.** `jev.sh triage <ids>` reads the worker terminals outside
  Jarvis's context and returns one line per worker, for example
  `a1b2 working (0.94)`. It shows the screen only for a worker that is
  blocked, asking, limited, finished, stuck, or unclear. Usage-limit messages
  are caught by a text rule, not by the model.

It also runs an experiment: each brief gets a **shadow** model-tier verdict
from Jev, logged next to the model Jarvis chose and how the brief turned out.
Jev's verdict is never shown to Jarvis and changes nothing. After about 30
briefs, `jev.sh report` tells you whether the classifier has earned an
advisory role. Nobody has published accuracy numbers for routing coding work
this way, so it has to earn it on your own briefs first.

**Jev advises and never decides.** Without `jq`, without a key, or when the
API fails or takes longer than 8 seconds, the script prints
`jev: skipped (…)`, exits cleanly, and Jarvis works exactly as it does without
it.

**Privacy.** Brief text (without its header) and the bottom 60 lines of
polled worker terminals are sent to TypeSafe. Secret-shaped strings are masked
first, but masking can miss things. If terminal contents must not leave your
machine, don't set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in that repo. Run any command with
`--dry-run` to see exactly what would be sent.

To turn it on, set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the shell profile your Superset
terminals load. Details are in
[`jev.md`](plugins/jarvis/skills/run/references/jev.md). The labelled fixtures
and the pass/fail gates used to test the questions are in [`eval/`](eval/).
`eval/selftest.sh` checks the fail-open paths and the masking with no key and no network.

## Customizing

After setup, **your repo's `handoffs/JARVIS.md` takes priority over the
skill**. Edit it to change what only Jarvis may do, how you verify work,
shared files, and any routing rule. Edit `handoffs/jarvis.conf` to change
the Claude cap, the band thresholds, the idle limit, and whether merges
push. Your checks live in `CLAUDE.md`.

Workers follow `AGENTS.md`. Add project-specific rules there, such as
"never edit `src/theme/tokens.ts`" or "use pnpm, not npm".

## Jarvis vs. `superset:orchestrate`

| | **Jarvis** | **`superset:orchestrate`** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shape | One lead agent that runs across sessions | A one-off fan-out |
| Checkout | Shared: workers in terminals of one workspace | An isolated worktree and branch per worker |
| Git | Jarvis commits each handoff to your branch | Results merged as PRs |
| Memory | `handoffs/OPEN.md` + `handoffs/merged/` | Per run |
| Model routing | Per task, based on usage | Your choice |
| Best for | Running a product day to day | "Split this migration into ten slices" |

They work well together. Use Jarvis for daily work, and have it use
`orchestrate` for a big parallel job when needed.

## FAQ and troubleshooting

**`superset: command not found`**
Jarvis only works inside Superset. Install it from
[docs.superset.sh/install](https://docs.superset.sh/install) and run Jarvis
from a Superset terminal, where `superset` and `$SUPERSET_WORKSPACE_ID` are
available.

**A worker won't start: "unknown model"**
Your host doesn't accept that model ID. The error lists the IDs it does
accept. Update the table in your `CLAUDE.md`, or run `jarvis:setup` again to
check the IDs.

**Codex or OpenCode rows don't work**
Check `superset agents list --local`. If an agent isn't configured there,
Jarvis sends those tasks to Claude models until you add it.

**Two Jarvis sessions are running**
`jarvis start` writes the session's terminal ID to `OPEN.md`. If the recorded
Jarvis terminal is still open, it refuses, and Jarvis asks you before taking
over.

**My message was stopped: "Jarvis has been idle … min"**
That's the idle guard. Jarvis's prompt cache has expired, so your message
would have paid to write its whole context again. Type `/clear` and then
"resume" for a cheap fresh session that reloads from `OPEN.md`. Or send the
same message again to go ahead anyway.

**`jarvis spawn` refused: "Claude cap reached"**
That's working as intended. The brief waits under To-do and is spawned when
a worker is merged. If the task is small and fenced, OpenCode or Codex can
take it now. Raise `JARVIS_MAX_CLAUDE` in `handoffs/jarvis.conf` if you want
more parallel Claude sessions and accept the faster burn.

**`band: unknown`**
The statusline tap hasn't produced a reading yet. It needs `jq`, and the
repo's `.claude/settings.json` must set the statusline. Until it has a
reading, Jarvis asks you for your `/usage` numbers.

**A worker is stuck on a permission prompt**
Jarvis sees it when it reads the worker's terminal and sends a nudge with
`superset terminals send`. You can also say "check on the workers".

**Can I use it without Codex?**
Yes. Everything except media and computer-use tasks runs on Claude. Without
Codex, the red band can't move heavy work anywhere, so you'll need to manage
usage more carefully.

**Does it work with other agents?**
Workers can be any Superset agent that reads `AGENTS.md`, such as Claude Code,
Codex, or OpenCode. Jarvis itself is written for Claude Code.

**Should `handoffs/` be in `.gitignore`?**
No. It's tracked on purpose as the project's memory. The one exception is
`handoffs/.jev/`, Jev's local log, which setup adds to `.gitignore`.

**`jev.sh` always says `skipped`**
The reason is in the brackets: `TYPESAFE_API_KEY not set` (export it in the
profile your Superset terminals load), `jq not installed`, or
`TypeSafe API unavailable` (a bad key, a network problem, or a reply slower
than 8 seconds). None of these stop Jarvis from working.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome, especially:

- updates when Superset CLI flags or model IDs change
- routing and efficiency improvements based on real usage
- clearer templates and setup questions

When editing skills, keep the templates' style: short rules in plain words,
each with its reason. Every line of a generated `CLAUDE.md` is read in every
Jarvis session, so leave out generic advice.

### Publishing a new version (maintainers)

```bash
superset plugins publish jarvis --bump patch
git commit -am "publish jarvis@<version>"
git tag jarvis@<version> && git push --tags
```

A release is a git tag, and installs pin to it. Keep the `version` in
`plugins/jarvis/plugin.json`, `plugins/jarvis/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and
`.agent-marketplace.json` the same.
