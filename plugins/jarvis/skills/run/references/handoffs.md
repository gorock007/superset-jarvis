# Briefs and handoffs

Both live in `handoffs/` at the repo root, which is tracked in git: it is the
project's memory. Jarvis moves a reviewed handoff into `handoffs/merged/` in
the same commit as the feature.

## Brief — Jarvis → worker

`handoffs/briefs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.md`, from `handoffs/briefs/TEMPLATE.md`.

Header: `worker`, `model`, `effort`, `started`, `terminal` (`jarvis spawn`
fills the last two). When the usage band changed the model choice, say so in the header
(`model: claude-opus-5-5 (amber band; fable-tier task)`) — a later re-spawn then knows
whether to go back up to `fable`. Body: **Goal** (verifiable), **Context** (decisions already made,
files to read, prior handoffs), **Scope** (may / must-not / shared files),
**Phase**, **Checks**, and the ask-once instruction.

**One brief per phase.** A multi-phase job is a chain of briefs. Each one
is spawned after the previous handoff is merged, with
`jarvis spawn <brief> --after handoffs/merged/<previous>.md`, so each worker
starts fresh from a written handoff. It doesn't drag the earlier phases'
context along.

Good briefs are disjoint: no two running briefs list the same "may touch"
file. If they must overlap, name the shared file in both and tell the second
worker to read the first's handoff before editing it.

## Handoff — worker → Jarvis

`handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.md`, from `handoffs/TEMPLATE.md`.

```markdown
# <one-line task title>
status: done | blocked | partial
agent: claude <model> | codex <model>
brief: handoffs/briefs/<file>.md
## What the user asked
## What changed
## Files
- path — created | modified | deleted
## Checks run
## Questions for the user
## Notes for Jarvis
```

- `blocked` means: questions in **Questions for the user**, nothing built yet.
  Jarvis batches them; the worker keeps its terminal open and waits for
  `terminals send`.
- `partial` means: some phases done, something stopped it. The **Files** list
  is still exact for what was touched.
- A worker that gets more instructions for the same task updates the same
  handoff file — Jarvis never has two handoffs for one brief.

## Reviewing a handoff (Jarvis)

1. **File list vs reality.** `jarvis merge <handoff> --check` compares the
   list against `git status` and prints the diff stat. Every listed path
   must be changed. Anything unlisted that obviously belongs to this task
   goes back to the worker. This is the single most important check, because
   Jarvis commits by the list.
2. **Diff.** `git diff -- <listed files>`; big diffs go to a Sonnet subagent
   for a summary. Look for edits to shared files that weren't named.
3. **Checks.** If **Checks run** is thin or says "not run", run them.
4. **Notes for Jarvis.** Do the Jarvis-only items (migration, release,
   lockfile). Note anything deferred in `OPEN.md`.
5. **Merge.** `jarvis merge <handoff> -m "<msg>" --outcome <o>` commits the
   listed files, the handoff move, the brief and `OPEN.md` in one commit,
   with a `Co-Authored-By` trailer for the worker. It pushes, closes the
   worker terminal and drops its `OPEN.md` lines.

## OPEN.md

One file, four lists: **Questions for the user**, **Running workers**,
**Waiting on Jarvis**, **To-do**. At the top are the current Jarvis terminal
id (`jarvis start`) and the usage band (`jarvis status`). `jarvis spawn`
and `jarvis merge` maintain **Running workers**. Jarvis can be `/clear`ed
between batches, so this file must always hold what a fresh session needs. Every state change above is a one-line edit here. Jarvis never
reconstructs state by scanning folders or terminals; if `OPEN.md` is wrong,
fix `OPEN.md`.
