  # note the reason when the usage band changed the choice, e.g. `claude-opus-5-5 (amber band; fable-tier task)`
effort: <low | medium | high | xhigh>
started: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> · terminal: <filled in by jarvis spawn>

## Goal
<what done looks like for THIS phase, in one paragraph>

## Context
<decisions already made, files to read first, the previous phase's handoff in handoffs/merged/>

## Scope
- May touch: <paths>
- Must not touch: <paths>
- Shared files (edit minimally, name in handoff): <paths>

## Phase
<one phase. A job with several phases gets one brief per phase; the next one
is spawned with `jarvis spawn <brief> --after <this handoff>`>

## Checks
<commands to run before handing off, output filtered: `pytest -q 2>&1 | tail -30`>

## Questions first
Put every question in one first handoff (`status: blocked`) and stop. After
the answers arrive on your terminal, finish this phase without stopping
again. If you have no questions, build straight through.
